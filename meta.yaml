    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}  # Tells conda to provide an appropriate C++ compiler
    - python           # Because weâ€™re building a Python extension via pybind11
    - pybind11         # Usually needed at build time for the headers
  host:
    - python
    - pybind11         # Also needed in the "host" env for cross-compilation
